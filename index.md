I study American politics and computational research methods at Penn State University. Iâ€™m particularly interested in ideology and polarization. My methodological approach focuses on natural language processing and machine learning. My disseratation advances methods of using language models in social science and examines the effect of affective polarization on legislative behavior. 

I received a BA in Economics and International Studies from Utah State University and an MA in Security Studies from Georgetown University, where I focused on terrorism and sub-state violence. Prior to studying at Penn State, I worked as a data scientist for Deloitte, where I consulted for Department of Defense clients.

I live with my wife, son, and three cats outside of State College. I love to cook, run, and tinker with computers.
